# Fishing-Simulator

The fishingSimulator.c is a program that simulates people fishing in a pond. In the program, fishers will try to catch fish and then they will keep some that they like in a bucket, while the ones that they donâ€™t like will be put back into the pond. In this simulation, a fisher will be allowed to catch at most 10 fish. The pond itself will have a maximum capacity of 15 fish. THis program utilizes multiple structs to represent the different entities in the simulation.

The dynamicVersion.c. is a dynamic version of fishingSimulator.c as it dynamically allocates the fish in the arrays (ias opposed to statically allocating them.
